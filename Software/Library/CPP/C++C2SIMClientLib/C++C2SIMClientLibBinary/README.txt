This directory contains the beta open source Windows implementation 
of the C++ C2SIMClientSTOMP_Lib and C2SIMClientREST_Lib from the GMU
C4I & Cyber Center. These are C++ clones of the Java versions
on https://openc2sim.github.io

To use the library copy the .lib files from lib64 and use header
file C2SIMClientLib2.h.

boost files in lib64 have been upgraded to vc140 (MVC15 compiled)

version 4.8.0.3 makes C2SIMClientREST_Lib thread-safe
