# .NET C2SIM Resources

Resources for interacting with C2SIM in .NET code:

* [C2SIMSDK](./C2SIMSDK) - Offers higher-level classes encapsulating common functionality required to interact with a C2SIM environment

* [C2SIMClinetLib](C2SIMClinetLib) - Lower-level access to REST and STOMP C2SIM services, ported from the [Java C2SIMClientLib 4.8.0.2 version](https://github.com/hyssostech/OpenC2SIM.github.io/tree/master/Software/Library/Java/C2SIMClientLib)

* [C2SIMSDKSampleApp](C2SIMSDKSampleApp) - Simple command line interface for interacting with C2SIM servers that illustrates the use of the .NET SDK

The SDK is available as a nuget package supporting .NET 6 and .NET Standard 2.0 (Framework) projects: [HyssosTech.Sdk.C2SIM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HyssosTech.Sdk.C2SIM/)
