Changes:

In cbml-composites.xsd
	In RouteWhereLight
		FromWhere, ViaWhere, and ToWhere type was changed from AtWhere to FVTWhere
		Added FVTWhereType so that we end up with
			<RouteWhere>
				<SpecificRoute>
					<FromWhere>
						<AtWhere>
							<SpecificLocation>

		Rather than:
			<RouteWhere>
				<SpecificRoute>
					<FromWhere>
						<SpecificLocation>
