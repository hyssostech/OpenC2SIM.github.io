# C2SIM Project Files

Command and Control Systems to Simulation Systems Interoperation (C2SIM) is defined in [SISO-STD-019-2020]((https://www.sisostds.org/DigitalLibrary.aspx?Command=Core_Download&EntryId=51765) 
as a standard for expressing 
and  exchanging  Command  and  Control  (C2)  information  among  C2  systems,  simulation  systems,  and  
robotic and autonomous (RAS) systems in a coalition context. 
Military operations in todayâ€™s world are increasingly driven towards coalition participation and as such are 
dependent  on  effective  interoperation  among  participating  coalition  systems.  The  growth  of  digitized  C2  
systems  and  the  need  for  coalition  interoperation  has  created  a  need  for  standards  to  represent  and  
exchange digitized C2 information and for these systems to interoperate. 

For a comprehensive C2SIM description, see the [C2SIM Overview](Reference/C2SIM-Overview1.pdf)
