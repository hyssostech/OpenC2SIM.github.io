# C2SIM Project Files

Command and Control Systems to Simulation Systems Interoperation (C2SIM) is defined in [SISO-STD-019-2020](https://www.sisostds.org/DigitalLibrary.aspx?Command=Core_Download&EntryId=51765) 
as a standard for expressing
and  exchanging  Command  and  Control  (C2)  information  among  C2  systems,  simulation  systems,  and 
robotic and autonomous (RAS) systems in a coalition context. 


For a comprehensive C2SIM description, see the [C2SIM Overview](Reference/C2SIM-Overview1.pdf)
